# Sorting Algorithms Performance Analysis

This project evaluates and compares the execution time of several sorting algorithms under different input conditions (average-case, best-case, and worst-case).

## Implemented Sorting Algorithms
- Bubble Sort  
- Insertion Sort  
- Selection Sort  
- Merge Sort  
- Quick Sort  
- Quick Sort (Median Pivot)  
- Quick Sort (Median-of-Three Pivot)

## Build & Run
Make sure you are in the same directory as the `Makefile`, then run:
-> make

This will compile all .cpp files into .o object files.
Link them into an executable named final.
Run the program
-> ./final

Clean Build Files
make clean
